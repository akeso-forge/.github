# Welcome to Akeso Forge ⚒️

Akeso Forge is an infrastructure-focused engineering entity dedicated to the stability and health of Cloud Native ecosystems. We build tools that bridge the gap between "broken" manifests and production-ready excellence.

## 🛠 Our Ecosystem

* **[akeso](https://github.com/akeso-forge/akeso):** Our open-source core. A powerful CLI tool for diagnosing and healing Kubernetes YAML logic.
* **KubeCuro:** The enterprise-grade caretaker for large-scale cluster health and automated manifest remediation.

## 🛡 Our Philosophy
We believe infrastructure should be **self-healing** and **logic-driven**. Our tools don't just find syntax errors; they understand the "intent" of your Kubernetes architecture and forge it into a hardened state.
